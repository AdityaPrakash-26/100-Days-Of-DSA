# Tree

It is a collection of nodes and the top node is taken as root node and rest of the nodes are divided into disjoint subsets. Each subset is aslo a tree. Also we can say that a tree is a "rooted , directed and acyclic " structure.

# Conditions to be a tree

1. Must have a root
2. Must have directed edges
3. Must not have a cycle

# Important Terms

## 1. Root

The top node is called the root

## 2. Parent

A node is a parent to its very next descendants.

## 3. Child

Those descendants that are connected with one edge.

## 4. Siblings

Children of same parent

## 5. Descendants

All the set of nodes that can be reached from a particular node.

## 6. Ancestors

All the nodes from that node to the root node.

## 7. Degree of node

The number of direct children of a node

## 8. Leaf node / External Nodes

Nodes with degree 0

## 9. Non-Leaf Nodes / Internal Nodes

Nodes with degree > 0

## 10. Level

The number of nodes in a given path.

## 11. Height

The number of edges in a given path

## 12. Forest

A collection of trees.
